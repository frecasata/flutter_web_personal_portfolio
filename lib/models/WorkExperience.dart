    title: "Thesis Project (2023) - Lead Programmer",
    description:
        """As the lead programmer for the research project, I assumed a pivotal role in driving the project's technological aspects and ensuring its successful execution.

One of my primary responsibilities was overseeing a team of programmers consisting of three members. Together, we collaborated on the development of a web-based HR Information System and a Raspberry Pi fingerprint attendance record system.

For the web-based HR Information System, we leveraged a range of technologies including the Java Ant Framework, Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), JSP pages with JSTL, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript, Apache Tomcat, JDBC, and MySQL. These tools provided a solid foundation for creating a comprehensive and intuitive system that effectively managed HR-related information.

In parallel, we also worked on the Raspberry Pi fingerprint attendance record system. This solution required a different set of technologies, and we utilized Python, MariaDB, and PySimpleGui to develop a reliable and efficient system for recording attendance using fingerprint recognition through Raspberry Pi devices.

Throughout the project, I took charge of managing the Git repository, ensuring version control, and maintaining code integrity. I placed significant emphasis on producing clean, well-structured code and actively coached and guided the team members in adopting and implementing industry best practices. By doing so, we achieved code consistency, readability, and maintainability, which were vital for the success of the project.

Additionally, my role as the lead programmer involved a deep understanding of the project's objectives and requirements. I actively engaged in identifying common business practices related to HR management, time and attendance management, and payroll. This knowledge allowed us to tailor the systems to effectively address the specific needs and challenges of the organization.

As the lead programmer, I played a vital role in driving the research project's technical aspects, fostering a collaborative environment, and ensuring the successful development and implementation of the web-based HR Information System and Raspberry Pi fingerprint attendance record system.

    title: "Data analysis final project (2023) - Lead programmer",
    description:
        """In the data analysis final project of 2023, I took on the role of the lead programmer, responsible for overseeing a team of two members. Our project focused on analyzing and presenting valuable key insights derived from a police crime dataset.

To begin the data analysis process, we utilized Python programming language along with the Pandas library and Jupyter Notebook. These tools enabled us to clean and preprocess the dataset, ensuring that the data was in a suitable format for analysis.

Once the dataset was prepared, we turned to Tableau, a powerful data visualization and analysis tool. Leveraging its capabilities, we conducted in-depth analysis of the crime dataset and generated visualizations that effectively communicated key insights to our stakeholders. Tableau allowed us to present the data in a visually appealing and easily understandable manner, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of crime patterns and trends.

One of our primary objectives in the project was to identify potential areas for improvement in crime prevention. By thoroughly analyzing the dataset, we extracted relevant information and patterns that could contribute to strategies aimed at reducing and preventing crime. We delved into the data, seeking correlations, trends, and anomalies that could inform decision-making and guide proactive measures.

Throughout the project, I led the team in the analysis process, ensuring that we maintained a rigorous and systematic approach. I fostered collaboration and encouraged the exchange of ideas and perspectives among team members, enhancing the quality and depth of our analysis.

As the lead programmer, my role encompassed overseeing the technical aspects of the project, guiding the team in using the appropriate tools, and ensuring the accuracy and integrity of our findings. Together, we successfully analyzed the police crime dataset, presented valuable key insights, and proposed potential avenues for crime prevention based on the data.

Overall, our data analysis final project encompassed team collaboration, Python-based dataset cleaning, Tableau-based data analysis and visualization, and the identification of actionable insights to improve crime prevention strategies.

    title: "Music Collaboration Web App Project (2021) - Lead Programmer",
    description:
        """In the Music Collaboration Web App project of 2021, I assumed the role of the lead programmer, responsible for leading a team of two members in the development of a collaborative web application tailored for musicians.

As the project lead, I guided and coordinated the team throughout the development process. Our main objective was to create a platform that facilitated collaboration among musicians, allowing them to connect, share ideas, and work together on music projects.

To achieve this, we utilized Java servlets and Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. These technologies provided a robust foundation for building the server-side components of the web application. We developed Java servlets to handle HTTP requests, manage user authentication and authorization, and implement the core functionalities of the collaboration platform.

In addition to servlets, we created Java Server Pages (JSP) pages. With the help of JSP, we dynamically generated the user interfaces and incorporated Java code into the web pages. This allowed us to deliver interactive and personalized experiences for musicians using the web app.

To store and manage the data, we designed a MySQL database. As the lead programmer, I took a proactive role in identifying and implementing best practices in database design. This involved defining the appropriate table structures, establishing relationships between entities, and optimizing the performance and efficiency of database queries.

Throughout the project, I ensured effective collaboration and communication within the team. We followed an agile development methodology, regularly conducting meetings and sprint reviews to track progress, address challenges, and align our efforts. As the lead programmer, I provided guidance and support to the team members, fostering a collaborative and productive environment.

By leveraging our technical skills in Java servlets, JSP pages, and MySQL database design, we successfully built a functional and user-friendly web application for musicians. The collaborative nature of the platform aimed to enhance musical creativity and facilitate seamless cooperation among musicians.

In conclusion, as the lead programmer of the Music Collaboration Web App project, I played a crucial role in leading the team, implementing Java servlets and JSP pages, and designing an efficient MySQL database. Our collective efforts resulted in the development of a valuable web application that empowered musicians to collaborate and create music together.
